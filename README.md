# SignalAnalysisAssignment

Welcome to the repository for the CMV Signal Analysis Assignment. This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python source code developed for the analysis and processing of signal data.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find organized and well-documented source code, crucial for understanding and implementing various signal analysis techniques. The code is structured to follow the logical flow of the assignment, ensuring a seamless and educational experience.

## Repository Contents

### Source Code

The `SourceCode` directory is divided into four subfolders, each corresponding to a specific stage of the signal analysis process:

1. **Pre-processing and Data Analysis** - `1Pre-processingAndDataAnalysis`
   - Focuses on initial data handling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
2. **Sampling Data and Anti-aliasing** - `2SamplingDataAndAnti-aliasing`
   - Deals with the intricacies of data sampling and the implementation of anti-aliasing techniques.
3. **Fourier Transform, Filter Application, and Inverse Fourier Transform** - `3FourierTransformFilterApplicationAndInerseFourierTransform`
   - Explores the application of Fourier Transforms, filtering methods, and their reversals.
4. **Restoring the Original Data** - `4RestoringTheOriginalData`
   - Concludes with methods and strategies to restore or reconstruct the original dataset from processed data.

### Datasets

Located in the `datasets` folder, you'll find three datasets crucial for the assignment. These datasets are formatted as `.data` files, which are essentially text files containing CSV-formatted data. The Python code in this repository is designed to open and process these files accordingly. The datasets are sourced from the following link: [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/194/wall+following+robot+navigation+data).

### Assignment Document

The `Assignment` folder contains the final comprehensive PDF document of the assignment. This document includes detailed explanations, results, and discussions related to the signal analysis conducted.
